Many freshwater fish are opportunistic feeders that forage on the bottom as well as in midwater and near the surface, also pertaining to forms which hover or swim just over the floor of the sea, e.g. Halosauridae, Macrouridae, Moridae, Brotulidae; the depth zone about 100 metres off the bottom at all depths below the edge of the continental shelf",

Living or feeding in open waters at depths between 1,000 and 4,000 m. In FishBase this term is used to include the depth range from 200 m to the bottom and thus the zones mesopelagic, bathypelagic and abyssopelagic",
