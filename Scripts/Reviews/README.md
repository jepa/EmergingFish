# Instructions from Editor

# IMPORTANT NOTES: 

1. We very strongly urge you to carefully edit and check your revised manuscript before you submit it. Please make sure that the revised text and related materials are truly in final, checked, and polished form. *We allow only minimal changes to manuscripts once materials are in galley form.*

2. Your supplementary materials will not be typeset or edited and will appear exactly as you submitted them. We will not be able to make changes at the galley stage.

3. All authors of papers we publish must complete our Conflict of Interest and License to Publish forms in their entirety and agree to our data and materials availability requirements. We do not publish papers unless all authors have completed these forms and until an open access license has been selected.

4. To make any changes in authorship, including adding, removing, or reordering the author list, you will need to submit a change of authorship form. If you have any questions, please contact our Editorial Office at ScienceAdvancesEditorial@aaas.org.

5. If you make changes after acceptance, publication will be delayed.

# Specific Tasks.

1) revise the MS in light of their comments

2) when you return the MS, *please copy and paste each entire review and beneath each reviewer comment*, explain how you addressed that issue in the revision

3) I will return the revised MS and your explanation of changes to these same two reviewers for re-review.


# Revission Checklist:

Research Articles:
[  ] Word Count: ~15,000 words (Review articles: ~15,000 words)
[  ] Reference List: ~ 60 citations total (Review articles: ~130 citations)
[  ] Main Figures/Tables: ~10 Figures/Tables Total (Combined) 

If your paper is accepted for publication, the accepted version is the manuscript that will be published. Changes made to any substantive text or data of any kind at the galley stage will likely result in a delay of the publication of your paper while changes are checked with editors. We strongly encourage you to read and check your revision very carefully before you submit it. 

1.	All authors will soon receive an email with a link to fill out the online author questionnaire (COI and license forms). While it is not required at this time, it will help speed up the final acceptance process should your paper be accepted for publication. We will not publish a paper until all authors have completed and submitted this questionnaire.  

2.	In your author paperwork, select that you have applied for a waiver *only* if your institution has its own publishing license. (Some institutions have policies that might limit authors' ability to grant AAAS the exclusive rights we require to publish a manuscript. Check your institution's copyright policy to see if there is a publication policy or Open Access policy that requires you to grant to the institution nonexclusive rights under copyright. If you need help, please ask your local librarian. If there is a policy, you will need to apply for a waiver.)   

3.	Please note that responsibility for each figure in the main text must be claimed by at least one author in the questionnaires.   

Your new cover letter should include:  

[  ] The correct email address and phone numbers for you and any other corresponding author who will need to receive galley proofs   
[  ] Telephone numbers for all authors.   

Please upload the following with your revised manuscript:  

[  ] A separate document with your responses to reviews, which you should label "Response to Reviews" and upload as "Response to Reviews" under Auxiliary Supplementary Materials. 
[  ] Individual figure files in high-resolution format (at least 600 DPI) so that they are clear when magnified and have legible text. We will need high-resolution files if your revised manuscript is fully accepted. 
[  ] Supplementary materials in a separate file or files (not part of main text) with figures and tables labeled using S1, S2, and so on.  
[  ] Evidence of permissions from the copyright holder to reproduce any previously published figures and photographs not taken by the authors.    

Your revised submission should:  

[  ] Be a Word document, not a PDF. 
Important Note:  If your manuscript file is in LaTeX, upload a PDF as the main manuscript file and the LaTeX file as supplementary material. We need both files for production.
[  ] Highlight any changes to the author list. (If there are changes, staff will send the authors a Change to Authorship form. All authors will need to approve the new author list.)  
[  ] Have changes to the original manuscript noted in highlighted text or a different color font. Do not use "track changes". 
[  ] Include clear, informative headings throughout. If possible, headings should follow the order of: "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", and "Materials and Methods." Results and Discussion sections can be combined into one if more applicable to the paper.
[  ] Be written primarily in active voice.  
[  ] Have all referenced images submitted in a clear and readable format and in correct order. 
[  ] Include a Materials and Methods section (these do not go in Supplementary Materials). 
Note: This does not apply for Review Articles.
[  ] State clearly that IRB and/or IACUC guidelines were followed with human or animal subjects. 
[  ] Include a reference list that         
      o  contains all references from the SM (SM cannot include a reference list)       
      o  does not include personal communications, working papers, or unpublished work of any kind       
      o  follows Science style (www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo/prep/res/refs.xhtml)  
[  ] Have acknowledgments that include:
      o  an accurate and complete Funding statement. This information should also be updated if needed in the submission system.
      o  a statement about conflicting interests along the lines of: "Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests." If this is not accurate, please list the competing interests.
      o  a breakdown of all author contributions. NOTE: All authors must be accounted for in this section.
      o  a data availability statement. Science Advances strongly encourages authors to put data in a publicly accessible repository, such as Dryad. At minimum, a statement similar to the following is required: "All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials."  Please also provide any database or other accession numbers that would help interested readers access data used in your study.
[  ] Include an accurate list of supplementary materials.   


Before submitting your revision, you should:  

[  ] Check to make sure all embedded links lead to active sites. 
[  ] Double-check information in tables.
