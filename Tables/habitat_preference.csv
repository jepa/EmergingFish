"","Habitat preference","Description"
"1","pelagic-neritic","The shallow pelagic zone over the continental shelf; nearshore ocean ecosystems; i.e., those associated with the coasts because the waters are overlying continental shelves and/or the waters are < 200 m deep in areas of coastal submarine slopes"
"2","reef-associated","A largely consolidated wave resistant feature; the upper surface is within 0-20 m of the ocean surface; in the tropics, the upper portion is typically composed mainly of living and non-living remains of coral and coralline algae; rock lying at or near the surface and which may pose a danger to navigation"
"3","bathydemersal","Living and feeding on the bottom below 200 m"
"4","benthopelagic","Living and feeding near the bottom as well as in midwaters or near the surface. Feeding on benthic as well as free swimming organisms. Many freshwater fish are opportunistic feeders that forage on the bottom as well as in midwater and near the surface, also pertaining to forms which hover or swim just over the floor of the sea, e.g. Halosauridae, Macrouridae, Moridae, Brotulidae; the depth zone about 100 metres off the bottom at all depths below the edge of the continental shelf"
"5","demersal","Sinking to or lying on the bottom; living on or near the bottom and feeding on benthic organisms"
"6","bathypelagic","Region of the oceanic zone between 1,000 m to 4,000 m; between the mesopelagic layer above and the abyssopelagic layer below. Living or feeding in open waters at depths between 1,000 and 4,000 m. In FishBase this term is used to include the depth range from 200 m to the bottom and thus the zones mesopelagic, bathypelagic and abyssopelagic"
"7","pelagic-oceanic","Living and feeding in the open sea; associated with the surface or middle depths of a body of water; free swimming in the seas, oceans or open waters; not in association with the bottom. Many pelagic fish feed on plankton. In FishBase, referring to surface or mid water from 0 to 200 m depth."
