# Project Goal:

- Determine the changes in in range shift of transboundary species 

## Files and folders organization:

In this repository you will find all of the code related to the manuscript *Matching the Time of Emergence of Transboundary Fish Stocks to Lead Time for Policy Response Under Climate Change*. **Note** that the code needs to compile data from external sources. Due to the large volume of data, these are not in *GitHub*. Please email me to discuss other ways to share the data.
