# Project Goal:

- Determine the changes in in range shift of transboundary species 

# Files and folders organization:

In this repository you will find all of the code related to the manuscript *Matching the Time of Emergence of Transboundary Fish Stocks to Lead Time for Policy Response Under Climate Change*. **Note** that the code needs to compile data from external sources. Due to the large volume of data, these are not in *GitHub*. Please email me to discuss other ways to share the data.

## Support data

Support data used in this project is called along the [`Initial_analysis.Rmd`]() script.

- **sau_matching_names.csv**, This is a cross-reference list of spatial entities between the Sea Around Us data, the United Nations data and Natural Earth shapefiles. 

- **eez_centroids.csv**, This data set contains the centroids (latitude and longitude) of the EEZs produced using the `sf` package.

## External Data (Secondary)

All *secondary data* (i.e., data collected or produced by others in previous efforts) used in this project are publicly available, but we are not allowed to make them available for the public. Please see below information on how to get access.

- **Transboundary_spp.csv**, This is the list of transboundary species identified by [Palacios-Abrantes *et al*., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74644-2) and can be retrieved from the project's github [FishForVisa](https://github.com/jepa/FishForVisa/tree/master/Data/Results) 

- **exploited_species_list.csv**, This list references the `taxon_key` with the `taxon_sci_name`. Can be extracted from the `toe_data.csv` (See [Primary data](https://github.com/jepa/EmergingFish#primary-data) above)

- **Neighbours_eez_id.csv**, This is the list of neighboring EEZs. Can be extracted from `toe_data.csv` (See [Primary data](https://github.com/jepa/EmergingFish#primary-data) above)

- **sau_catch_value_country_taxon_JEPA.csv**, This is the *Sea Around Us* (SAU) catch and value data within the world EEZs. Please contact the [SAU](http://seaaroundus.org) for data access.

- **DBEM raw species projection data**, projections of species distributions based on environmental variables were carried using a Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model [DBEM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304380016000053). Please contact Dr. William W.L. Cheung at The Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries ([IOF](https://oceans.ubc.ca/william-cheung/)) for further discussion of the DBEM model and raw data. 

- **GFDL raw environmental data**, sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, pH, silicate concentration and euphotic depth are from 10 ensembles (runs) of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model 2M (GFDLESM2M) under a high-emission cliamte change scenario. For data access, please visit The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project [ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/input-data-bias-correction/details/51/) website.

## Shapefiles

- **SAUEEZ_July2015.shp**, This is the *Sea Around Us* shapefile used to estimate the EEZ's centroids and presented in figures 3-5. See [Figure S1](https://github.com/jepa/EmergingFish/blob/gcb_rev/Figures/FigS1.png) for a graphical representation of the shapefile and contact the [SAU](http://seaaroundus.org) for a version of it. 

*Final note*. If you are interested in any data used in this research I encourage you to contact me so we can further discuss ways to move forward.
